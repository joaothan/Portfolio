# Proccess

This is a portfolio that I am actively working on to increase my knowledge in the FrontEnd and with languages such as JS, and HTML/CSS. 

I have added functionality to all buttons in this page and have made the images interactable to show both the title and description of the image.

The contact form is available for use by using the FormSubmit application. I have disabled the Captcha and added my own Success window with a go back button.

This portfolio is being hosted by github at https://joaothan.github.io/Portfolio/
